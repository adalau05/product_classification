Objective: To classify retail products into four categories using rules:

⭐ Stars – High sales, high margin, high traffic

🚦 Traffic Builders – High traffic/units sold, low margin

💎 Hidden Gems – Low traffic, high margin, strong profitability

🪦 Dead Stock – Low sales, low margin, low movement

Classifying retail products into these four categories is useful because it turns raw sales and margin data into clear strategic actions. Each category represents a different role that products play in your assortment—and knowing that role helps you optimize pricing, promotion, inventory, and merchandising.
